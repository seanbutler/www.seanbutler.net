## Elite

Most programmers esp those who do video games and esp those who are old enough will know about Elite. Its Braben and Bell's seminal space trading RPG. Using pseudo random numbers to drive procedural generation it managed to 8 galaxies of 256 star systems in 32K. [you can read lots about it on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)).

## Text Elite

Text Elite is a reimplementation of the universe generation algorithm from this game by Ian Bell. [The sources are available online](http://elitehomepage.org/text/index.htm). However as they stand they dont run on modern machines.

## Patch

[This repo](https://github.com/seanbutler/TxtElite) driven by CMake downloads the src archive from Ian Bell's website and compiles a patched version that can run on modern machines. Its not super sophisticated but just the first step I had to carry out for a different project.

Share & Enjoy!
