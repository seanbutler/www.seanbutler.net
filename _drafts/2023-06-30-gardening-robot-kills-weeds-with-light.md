) is my new favourite robot in the whole world. like future solar punk in the wild! rather than using pesticides to kill weeds sunlight does a greener job with the application of machine learning and computer vision to recognise weeds and some pieces of wood to make a raspberry pi powered trundler. 

we can only hope for a future future where an army of solar powered trundlers pass over the home vegetable gardens in a post capitalist world making plenty of food for everyone. fingers crossed.
