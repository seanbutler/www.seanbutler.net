when working at a facebook game company (the now defunct soshi games), the received wisdom from our leadership and other gamedevs was that gamification doesnt work. they suggested its a fad that had been popular and promoted for a while when non game devs discoverd game design and applied its motivations to business and marketing.

### apparently gamification doesnt work

problem is, the mechanisms of gamification clearly have effects.  gamification is everywhere so many things around us follow similar patterns. i suspet the rewards are perhaps not what non-gamers thing they are.


### gaming with limited social contact

back in the day the kids would play arcade games at a convenience store near school, galaxians, scrambler, asteroids and so on. for a generation who had only seen tv up to this point the games themselves were a breath of interaction and saturated colours and agressive soounds. also some of these games let you put your initials in when you got a high score. of course you could brag to a friend that you got so many points, but that meant so much more if your initials were up there, no arguments. 

during this time part of the pleasure came from the games, but part from having _my_ name on that leaderboard.

when playing video games on the n64 there wasnt much opportunity to share scores with other people if they didnt have the same game as you. for one thing it didnt mean anything to them, you collected how many garibs on the castle zone of gorgon panick? who cares? if they did have the game then the mathematical accomplishment wasnt verifiable unless they had your cart or came round to play at your house etc.

during this time most of the feelings of pleasure i got from games was related to the traversal, either geography or of story. how far i had got. how much of the game had i experienced.

### fast forward

yeah so, the thing about using the apple tracker is that some times I just forget it and leave my phone at home. the inevitable gotcha moment happens sometime after passing the front door and the decision to return hinges on deciding how much i want to walk further versus how much i want to have my steps recorded by the app.

lets assume we cant go back, what recourse do we have? i could give my phone to someone and ask them to take it on a walk for me.

when we go roller skating as a family despite feeling extremely knackerd afterwards i fin that the fitness tracker hasnt recorded the dozens of laps as very many steps at all. 

ho hum. what is this post a solution or a complaint? how can i add exercise to my apple phone fitness tracker, its sometimes innacurate and i am sometimes forgetful.

perhaps the pressure to close my fitness rings is to much and the social gamification between the family is actually pretty effective.
