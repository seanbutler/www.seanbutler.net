# Tabletop Game Design for Engineers  
## Meta, Hidden-Rule, and Evolving Games

---

## Meta Hidden Rule & Evolving Tabletop Games

<!-- **Module:** Game Design for Engineers   -->
<!-- **Session:** Meta Hidden Rule & Evolving Tabletop Games   -->
<!-- **Focus:** Rules as systems, not artefacts -->

---

## Slide 2: Why Start With Games?
- Engineers learn best from **concrete systems**
- Games are **executable rule-sets**
- Meta-games expose assumptions early:
  - What is a rule?
  - Who enforces it?
  - When does a game exist?

---

## Slide 3: What Do We Mean by “Meta” Here?
- Games where **rules, awareness, or change** are part of play
- Often:
  - Rules change
  - Rules are hidden
  - Rules are performed socially
- Less about winning, more about **system behaviour**

---

## Slide 4: Introducing the Game Set
We will look at a *family* of tabletop games:

- **Fluxx** – rules and goals change during play  
- **1000 Blank White Cards** – players create rules and cards  
- **Mao** – rules exist but are not explained  
- **Mornington Crescent** – pretend / performative rules  
- **The Mind** – coordination without communication  
- **Hanabi** – hidden information, constrained communication  

---

## Slide 5: Quick Descriptions (No Analysis Yet)
- **Fluxx:** “The rules are always changing”
- **1000 Blank White Cards:** “The game designs itself”
- **Mao:** “Learn the rules by being punished”
- **Mornington Crescent:** “Act as if the rules are complex”
- **The Mind:** “Play in order without speaking”
- **Hanabi:** “You can see everyone’s cards but your own”

Goal: *understand the feel, not the theory (yet).*

---

## Slide 6: What These Games Have in Common
- Minimal components
- Heavy reliance on **social interaction**
- Rules are:
  - Mutable
  - Opaque
  - Or socially enforced
- Players must **reason about the system**, not just optimise moves

---

## Slide 7: First Review – Surface Differences
| Game | Rules Known? | Rules Change? | Social Reliance |
|-----|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Fluxx | Yes | Yes | Medium |
| 1000 Blank White Cards | Partial | Yes | High |
| Mao | No | No | High |
| Mornington Crescent | Irrelevant | Performative | Very High |
| The Mind | Yes | No | High |
| Hanabi | Yes | No | High |

---

## Slide 8: Introducing Analysis Axes
To compare these games, we’ll use **design axes**:

1. Rule Transparency  
2. Rule Evolution  
3. Player Agency  
4. Cognitive Load  
5. Social Enforcement  

These axes let engineers **compare unlike systems**.

---

## Slide 9: Axis 1 – Rule Transparency
- **Explicit:** all rules known (Fluxx, Hanabi)
- **Hidden:** rules must be inferred (Mao)
- **Pretend:** rules are a performance (Mornington Crescent)

Key question:
> “Can reading the rules fully prepare you to play?”

---

## Slide 10: Axis 2 – Rule Evolution
- **Static:** rules do not change
- **Dynamic:** rules change during play
- **Emergent:** rules arise socially

Examples:
- Fluxx → dynamic  
- 1000 Blank White Cards → emergent  
- Mao → static but hidden  

---

## Slide 11: Axis 3 – Player Agency
- **Structured:** actions tightly constrained
- **Semi-structured:** rules guide, players interpret
- **Emergent:** players invent meaning

Engineers: note similarity to **APIs vs frameworks vs free-form systems**

---

## Slide 12: Axis 4 – Cognitive Load
- Memory burden
- Rule-tracking
- Social inference
- Timing and attention

Hidden rules ≠ low complexity.

---

## Slide 13: Axis 5 – Social Enforcement
Who enforces correctness?

- The system?
- Other players?
- Shared fiction?

Most meta-games rely on **people, not mechanics**.

---

## Slide 14: Synthesis – Families of Meta Games
From the axes, we get **three families**:

1. **Dynamic-rule games** (Fluxx)
2. **Hidden-rule games** (Mao)
3. **Pretend-rule games** (Mornington Crescent)

1000 Blank White Cards deliberately spans all three.

---

## Slide 15: Why This Matters for Engineers
- Rules are **state machines**
- Social enforcement is an **external process**
- Hidden rules resemble:
  - Reverse engineering
  - Black-box testing
  - Protocol discovery

Game design becomes **systems design**.

---

## Slide 16: Play Session – Group Activity
In groups of 3–6:
- Play **one** assigned game
- Do *not* over-explain
- Observe:
  - Confusion
  - Adaptation
  - Rule negotiation
  - Social dynamics

---

## Slide 17: Post-Play Review Questions
After play, discuss:
- Which axis dominated the experience?
- Where did frustration come from?
- Who held authority?
- What broke when assumptions failed?

---

## Slide 18: Takeaways
- Games are **rules + people + context**
- Meta-games expose hidden design levers
- Engineers gain insight by:
  - Playing first
  - Abstracting second
  - Designing last

Next: design your own meta or evolving tabletop game.
