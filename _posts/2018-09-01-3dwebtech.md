<!-- # 3d Technologies for the Web -->

[Here](https://seanbutler.github.io/3DWebTechCourse/)
 are the lecture slides and tutorial worksheets for a module I used to teach at UWE to second year undergraduate Digital Media students.
There are a semester's worth of exercises and lecture slides.

The goals were as follows:

- Learn javascript and Three.js to create web pages with 3d graphics including, geometry, materials, cameras, lights, animation.

- Store and manage your projects with GitHub Desktop.

- Link the user interactionm to the 3d graphics to make them interactive.

By the end you will be able to create complex realtime 3d simulations which run in a web page.
