tucked away inside [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC) on the software tinyBASIC is the origin of the term copyleft. there are *also* several bombshells about early open source and the power of freedom, openess and community. 

its super interesting how a heavy handed approach to some community piracy spurred these people on to develop their own opensource alternative.
