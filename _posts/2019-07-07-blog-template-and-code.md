This site is built on the great open source static site generator 'jekyll', google it. There are lots of free styles you can apply when using it, but they tend to make your site look similar to other peoples.

I wanted a site that:
 - easy to read on any screen, so both zoomable and text reflowing in case you need to adjust
 - standard fonts for speedy rendering
 - wherever possible use existing style and visual language, links should be underlined, etc
 - works well on mobile, usable with thumb
 - given lack of control of ambient light uses a dark theme on mobile and a light theme on desktop
 - includes nothing unnecessary

The site code and style is open source, you can use it for your own projects, its available on [github](https://github.com/seanbutler/www.seanbutler.net). A link back is appreciated but not necessary. While the style and layout code is available to use, the actual content isnt, thats mine you cant have it.
