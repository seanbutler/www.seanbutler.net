The youngest offspring in our house enjoys maths, but like most/all children is subject to temptation and easily distracted, so ive been reticent to give them unfettered access to an ipad or iphone.

Written for the M5Cardputer with this game they can challenge themselves on arithmetic or times tables etc, but there are no other games available and its not the end of the world if its lost or dropped.

Loosely based on the kind of maths outlined in the uk key stage 1 & 2 curriculum in the UK.
