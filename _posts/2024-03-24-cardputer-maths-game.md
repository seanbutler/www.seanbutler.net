A maths game written for the new M5 Cardputer. Suitable for a primary/middle schooler.

This approach because I can give it to my offspring, the games are focussed on her needs, also there is no internet or other similar distractions.

Also the device is cheap enough that they can have it and take it anywhere and its not the end of the world if they lose it.

Loosely based on the kind of maths outlined in the uk key stage 1 & 2 curriculum in the UK.
