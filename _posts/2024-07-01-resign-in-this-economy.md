"resign in this economy you must be mad!". maybe, resigning from a 'good' job in an environment of layoffs could definately be considered a weird choice to make. which im happy to discuss in a call.

take a look at my [cv/resume](/SeanButler_CurriculumVitae.pdf) and [linked in profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanbutler) where others will tell you their experience of working with me and how i impacted the team.
