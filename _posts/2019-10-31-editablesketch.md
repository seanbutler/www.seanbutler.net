A little web sketch which shows how to build an editor into your web page from scratch. There is a floating draggable text field with some simple js code in it. 

You can [play](https://seanbutler.github.io/Sketches/Editable/) with it or take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/seanbutler/Sketches/tree/master/Editable).


- You can edit the example code. 
- Try removing the remove the comments (//), etc.
- Click DO to run the code. 
- DRG allows you to reposition the window and CLR clears the text box. 


Certainly there are more complete and involved examples of web page code editors online, this example is meant to show you how to do it as simply as possible from scratch with the minimum external libraries.
