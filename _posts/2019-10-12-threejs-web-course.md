Materials for an undergraduate module taught to creative technology students.
Makes use of references to three.js and artistic theories such as procedural rhetoric and cybernetics.

Includes how to program three.js and buried inside is a little bit of mesh manipulation which is core to procedural generation in 3d.

Not complete but put on ice due to low numbers, the program had 25 students that year and only 5 chose this year. Needs more work, like all teaching materials.
