A little web sketch using three.js which generates volcanic style islands in an ocean. I wrote about this approach to appear in the upcoming PROCJAM Zine [Seeds](http://www.procjam.com/seeds/) 2019 edited by [@Jupiter_Hadley](https://twitter.com/Jupiter_Hadley).

It generates a random set of volcanoes then throws out rocks and accumulates landscape where they hit the ground. This way the islands grow in a very natural way. Not at all like traditional methods.

Simple rotating sun & moon to add some mood and an undulating ocean to make it pretty

You can [play](https://seanbutler.github.io/Sketches/Island/) with it or take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/seanbutler/Sketches/tree/master/Island).
