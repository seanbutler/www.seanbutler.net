Here is a repo for a [minimal docker project](https://github.com/seanbutler/minimal_docker_cmake_cpp) providing the absolute bare minimum to integrate cmake and docker and c++.

Having found the starting with new tech problematic and wished for similar minimal repo for other new tech I hope this is useful to you if you are starting out with a github CMake docker project. 

This follows an [earlier post]({% post_url 2024-03-22-v8-sfml-skeleton-repo %}) I made for getting started working with v8 and c++ by integrating with sfml.
