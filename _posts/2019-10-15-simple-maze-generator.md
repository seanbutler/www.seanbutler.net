At the core of procedural level generation is often a maze generation algorithm. Often a semi-randomised path designed to fill the availab space.

In this case we do a randomised depth first search and when/if we reach a dead end, backtrack a bit and try again. This way our path branches when necessary and fills the entire space.

Some sliders let you adjust size and so on, the sourcecode is there if you want to know how it works.
