Any sufficiently advanced technology has a learning curve that is steep (with apologies to Clarke). Plenty of tutorials exist but there comes a time when you step beyond the intro tutorial and build your own project from scratch. Or integrate this new tech into your existing project.

One thing I've found is that taking apart existing projects as a step on your learning journey of a new technology can be frought with problems. 

- CMake is a moving target. 
- The project could involve dependancies you arent interested in. 
- Or a number of other factors which make it harder to get started with the specific technology you are interested in learning.

Perhaps you have wished for a simple skeleton repo that demonstrates how to get started without any additional dependances?

[Here is a repo](https://github.com/seanbutler/sfmlv8) for a minimal v8 integration project.
