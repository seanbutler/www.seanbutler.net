### You need an AST for any serious language


#### Notes:

- Non-trivial languages require a tree IR for correctness, optimisation, or maintainability.
- One-pass compilers, threaded interpreters, direct-eval VPLs contradict this.
- Consider Embedded, scripting, gameplay, DSLs.


#### Anecdotes: 
- Job Interview
- Conversations with Peers
